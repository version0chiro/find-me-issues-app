## About The Project:
<p align="center">
You know what is one of most painful thing for programmers new to open-source? Finding beginner friendly projects to contribute to!
After a good start of my web-app find me issues, I present you the native version which can run right on your fingers!
</p>

<p align="center">
Weirdly enough sometimes I am on the move or not in front of my laptop, I still wanna book mark some good issues to work on when I get a change to do so. Well, here is my solution for anyone facing a similar problem!
</p>

<p align="center">
Currently only in beta stage, the app allows you to filter repositories on basis of language and issue labels, which you can enter in the front page!
</p>

## Screenshots of the App:

Any and all kinds of suggestions are highly welcome! There is a plan for this application to go live on APP store soon after addition of a couple of new features! That's where you come in!
